# EduQuest - Frontend

The frontend of EduQuest, an education challenge's project developed at TreeHacks 2021, the prestigious hackathon organised by Stanford University (United States).

The backend of EduQuest is available [here](https://github.com/pablomatgar/EduQuest_Back).

### Inspiration

During the pandemic, education had to be online everywhere. The current education technologies are good for teaching but don't catch the attention of the students, which usually leads to a disconnect from what the teacher says and a struggle to focus on and understand the lesson. That is why we decided to develop EduQuest.

### What it does

EduQuest is a demo of an online teaching platform that includes a video chat and different "quests" issued by the teacher that the student has to complete to get points. The quests provide the teacher ways to set goals for the students and encourage them to engage with the learning material, while the points system incentivizes students to complete the quests.

### How we built it

We used React and Firebase to develop this project, Chakra UI to style it, and GitHub for version control.

### Challenges we ran into

Creating a video chat, even one that would only have a maximum of two people, proved to be the greatest challenge because of its complexity, and therefore took the longest time to implement. In addition, we had to create the API by ourselves to try to connect the frontend with the Firebase database, which was difficult at some points.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

We have a working demo with the main functionalities, including a login system and a basic video chat system, which we managed to finish within a short period.

### What we learned

We learned a lot of new skills about React developing and working with APIs and libraries, such as better programming techniques.

### What's next for EduQuest

We would like to create a system of mesh peers, instead of just one to one peers for the video chat and implement other video chat functions such as screen sharing and text chat. We would also like to expand the gamification aspects of the project, such as profile customization, a points-based shopping system, and more achievements and rewards for the students.
